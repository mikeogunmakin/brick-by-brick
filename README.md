# ðŸ§± Brick by Brick

A living repository of my journey in data science â€” built brick by brick.  
Each folder or note represents a small step forward: skills stacked, concepts clarified, and experiments run.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repo is my personal knowledge base for:
- Documenting what I learn as I upskill in **data science, machine learning, and AI**  
- Creating concise notes, summaries, and code snippets I can revisit later  
- Tracking progress and growth over time  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The repo is organised into topic-based folders (bricks), such as:
- **Problem Scoping** â€“ maths, statistics, Python essentials  
- **Machine Learning** â€“ models, evaluation, feature engineering  
- **Deep Learning** â€“ neural networks, transformers, embeddings  
- **Data Engineering** â€“ pipelines, SQL, cloud, tools  
- **Projects** â€“ experiments, case studies, applications  
- **Readings** â€“ papers, articles, books with key takeaways  

## ðŸš€ Guiding Principles
- **Consistency > Intensity** â†’ Small daily/weekly notes compound over time  
- **Clarity > Completeness** â†’ Capture the core insight, not every detail  
- **Sharing > Hoarding** â†’ Open-sourcing my notes to learn in public  

## ðŸŒ± Inspiration
This repo is inspired by the idea that growth happens incrementally.  
Like laying bricks, each skill or concept adds up to something bigger.
