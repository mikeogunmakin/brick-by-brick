# Why Machine Learning?

## ðŸ”¹ What is Machine Learning?
- Field at the **intersection of statistics, AI, and computer science**.  
- Also known as **predictive analytics** or **statistical learning**.  
- Goal: **Extract knowledge from data**.

## ðŸ”¹ Real-World Applications
- **Everyday life**:
  - Movie, food, product recommendations  
  - Personalized radio playlists  
  - Automatic photo tagging (e.g., recognising friends)  
- **Commercial platforms**:
  - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix â†’ almost every part powered by ML models  
- **Scientific research**:
  - Understanding stars, discovering planets/particles  
  - DNA sequence analysis  
  - Personalized cancer treatments

## ðŸ”¹ Why ML over Handcoded Rules?
### Early approach â†’ Rule-based systems ("ifâ€“else" logic)
- Example: Spam filter using blacklisted words.  
- **Limitations**:
  1. **Task-specific** â†’ Changing task requires rewriting rules.  
  2. **Expert knowledge needed** â†’ Requires deep human understanding of process.  

### ML advantage â†’ Learns from data
- Example: **Face detection**  
  - Handcoded rules failed â†’ computers perceive pixels differently from humans.  
  - ML succeeds by training on **large collections of face images**, discovering features automatically.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways
- ML enables systems to **adapt, generalise, and improve** without manual rule-coding.  
- More **scalable and flexible** than rule-based approaches.  
- Powers modern applications in commerce, science, and daily life.
